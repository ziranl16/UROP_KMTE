UROP Project 2021
This Repo is the source code for my UROP project. I propose a new Knowledge Graph Embedding which is based on Survival Analysis. The project is still in progress.

Dataset
The dataset that we used in our inital experiment is uploaded to Google Drive and can be found here. Please first create a data folder under the project directory, then extract the dataset into the data folder.
